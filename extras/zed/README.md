## Usage

Create a directory `~/.config/zed/themes` if it does not already exist.

Copy `cyberdream.json` and/or `cyberdream-light.json` to the directory.

Open [Zed](https://zed.dev) and select the theme under `Settings -> Select Theme -> Cyberdream (dark|light)`.

Alternatively, put the following config into your `settings.json` under `~/.config/zed`.

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "mode": "system",
    "light": "Cyberdream light",
    "dark": "Cyberdream dark"
  }
}
```
