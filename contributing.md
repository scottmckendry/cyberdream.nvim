## Adding Support for Plugins 📦

If you'd like to add support for a plugin that isn't currently supported by cyberdream.nvim, you can do so by creating a new file in the `lua/cyberdream/extensions` directory. The file should be named after the plugin, with the `.lua` extension. The format is as follows:

```lua
-- lua/cyberdream/extensions/plugin-name.lua
local M = {}

--- Get extension configuration
--- @param opts Config
--- @param t CyberdreamPalette
function M.get(opts, t)
    opts = opts or {}
    local highlights = {
        -- Add your highlights here
        -- See lua/cyberdream/colors.lua for a complete list of available colors in the palette
        HighlightGroupName = { fg = t.blue },
        AnotherHighlightGroupName = { fg = t.purple, bg = t.bgHighlight },
    }

    return highlights
end
return M
```

Once you've created the extension file, you'll need to add it to the `extensions` table in `lua/cyberdream/config.lua` and update the `extensions` type definition. If you've done this correctly, the highlights will apply the next time the plugin is loaded.

## Adding Extras 🎨

We support a number of terminals and other goodies to make the cyberdream experience even better. These are dynamically generated using GitHub actions. This ensures that both light and dark mode variants are generated with minimal effort while adhering as closely as possible to the [cyberdream palette](https://github.com/scottmckendry/cyberdream.nvim/blob/main/lua/cyberdream/colors.lua).

> [!NOTE]
> Do not edit the extras directly. Your changes will be overwritten the next time the GitHub action runs.

To add a new extra, create a new template file in the `lua/cyberdrem/extras` directory. Use the existing templates as a guide. Once you've created the template, you'll need to add it to the `extras` table in `lua/cyberdream/extras/init.lua`, including the extension and name.

Once you've done this, the extra will be generated the next time the GitHub action runs. You can find the generated extras in the `extras` directory.
